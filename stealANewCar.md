# Option 2: Steal a New Car

The car sputters, gasping for fuel as you scan the dimly lit street. You’re too close to the police perimeter to stop now. Every second counts. Your eyes lock onto a sleek black sedan parked just up ahead. It's your only chance.

“We're stealing that one,” you say, pointing. Your crew exchanges worried glances, but they follow your lead. Alex, grimacing in pain, clutches their injured leg, trying to keep up as you quietly approach the car.

The streets are eerily quiet, but you can hear the distant sirens growing louder. You pop open the door, and with shaking hands, you start to hotwire the vehicle. Time seems to slow. Sweat drips down your face as the wires spark, your heart racing in sync with the ticking clock in your mind.

Finally, the engine roars to life. Relief washes over you, but it’s short-lived. Alex stumbles as they try to climb in, their injury worse than you thought. The car feels like salvation, but Alex’s labored breathing reminds you that not everyone might make it through this night unscathed.

With the new car, the diamond is still in your possession. But as you speed down the street, you can't help but wonder:

* Will Alex hold on long enough to reach safety?
* Have you bought yourself enough time, or are the cops closing in faster than you realize?
* How far are you willing to go to protect the diamond — and each other?
