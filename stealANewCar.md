# Option 2: Steal a New Car

The car sputters, gasping for fuel as you scan the dimly lit street. The adrenaline from the heist is wearing off, but the reality of the situation is sinking in fast. You're too close to the police perimeter to stop now. Every second counts. Your eyes lock onto a sleek black sedan parked just up ahead. It's a gamble, but it's your only chance.

“We're stealing that one,” you say, pointing. Your crew exchanges worried glances, the weight of the night settling over them. Alex, grimacing in pain, clutches their injured leg, their breaths shallow and labored. They try to keep up, but it’s clear they’re slowing the group down.

The streets are eerily quiet, too quiet, but you can hear the distant sirens growing louder with every passing second. The tension is suffocating, and you know time is running out. You make your way to the sedan, your footsteps cautious and measured. There's no room for error. You glance over your shoulder, scanning the shadows for any signs of movement. The police could be around the next corner.

With a quick glance to your crew, you pop open the door of the sedan, fingers trembling as you fumble for the wires. The pressure is mounting. Each breath feels heavy as your mind races through the possibilities: getting caught, losing the diamond, or worse—watching one of your crew go down.

The wires spark in your hands as you work to hotwire the car, your heart pounding in sync with the ticking clock in your mind. Time seems to slow, every second stretched out like an eternity. The sirens are closer now. You can practically feel the blue-and-red lights flashing behind your eyes. Sweat drips down your face, mixing with the cold night air.

Finally, the engine roars to life, shattering the silence. For a fleeting moment, relief washes over you. But it's short-lived. Alex stumbles as they try to climb in, their face pale from blood loss. The makeshift bandage isn’t doing much to stem the bleeding, and the car that feels like salvation to you might as well be a hearse for them. You can hear their labored breathing, each gasp a reminder that not everyone might make it through this night unscathed.

You help Alex into the backseat, heart heavy with worry, and slam the door shut. There’s no time to think. You hit the gas and tear down the street, the new car cutting through the night like a lifeline. The diamond is still in your possession, tucked safely in your bag, but the weight of it feels heavier than before.

As you speed through the winding streets, dodging the occasional passerby, questions race through your mind like a relentless storm:

* Will Alex hold on long enough to reach safety? How long before the blood loss becomes too much?
* Have you bought yourself enough time, or are the cops closing in faster than you realize?
* How far are you willing to go to protect the diamond — and each other? Will you sacrifice the loot to save a friend, or is the crew’s bond built on shaky ground?

The city blurs past you, the high-stakes chase turning the familiar streets into an unforgiving maze. There's no turning back now.
