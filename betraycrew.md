# Option 3: Betray Crew
You glance around nervously, your heart racing with anticipation. You've decided to betray your crew and take the diamond for yourself. As you reach for the door handle, you hear the sound of footsteps approaching.

Your crew member, Sarah, appears beside you, her eyes narrowing suspiciously. "Hey, what's going on?" she asks, noticing the tension in your body language.

You hesitate, weighing your options. Do you:

Confess your betrayal and try to convince Sarah to join you
Deny everything and attempt to deflect suspicion
Attack Sarah and try to overpower her
Choose your response carefully, as this decision will have far-reaching consequences for both you and your crew.
