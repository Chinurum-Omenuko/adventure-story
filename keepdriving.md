# Option 4: Keep driving
You grip the steering wheel tightly, your heart racing with every passing mile. The city lights blur together as you push the getaway car to its limits, the engine roaring beneath you. Your crew's anxious faces reflect the tension building inside you.

Alex, still clutching their wounded leg, winces with each jolt of the vehicle. "How much longer?" they ask, their voice laced with fear and exhaustion.

You hesitate, unsure how much farther you can drive on fumes. The dashboard light flickering ominously suggests you're running perilously close to empty. But you press on, driven by a mix of desperation and determination.

As the hours drag on, the urban landscape gives way to suburban sprawl, then rural roads winding through dense forests. The silence between you grows thicker, punctuated only by the hum of the engine and the occasional distant siren.

Your mind races with worst-case scenarios - being stranded in the middle of nowhere, facing arrest at a random checkpoint, or worse yet, running out of fuel entirely. The unknown stretches out before you like an endless, treacherous road.

Suddenly, a sign catches your eye: "Gas Station - Next Exit." Your heart leaps with hope, but caution quickly sets in. Is this a trap? Will your crew be able to blend in?

You slow down, scanning the surroundings nervously. As you approach the exit, you notice a small convenience store alongside the gas pumps. It looks deserted, but it might be your only chance.

Do you: A) Pull into the gas station, hoping to refuel and gather information B) Drive past, too afraid to stop C) Try to find another route, avoiding potential danger altogether

What will you do next?
