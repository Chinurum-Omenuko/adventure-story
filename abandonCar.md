# Option 1: Abandon the Getaway Car and Split Up
You glance in the rearview mirror, watching as the museum's grand entrance fades into the distance. Your crew's injured member, Alex, is slumped in the backseat, their leg bleeding through the makeshift bandage.

You pull over, and your crew gathers their belongings. Alex struggles to stand, wincing in pain. You make the difficult decision to leave the diamond behind, sacrificing the loot to avoid getting caught.

As you split up, you can't shake the feeling that you're abandoning more than just the diamond. You watch as your crew disappears into the crowd, Alex limping along with the help of a makeshift crutch.

The city seems to stretch out before you like an endless, uncaring expanse. You're alone now, with nothing but your thoughts to keep you company. A sense of melancholy washes over you, a sense of loss and regret.

You're left wondering:

Will Alex be okay?
Will you ever see your crew again?
Was it all worth it?
